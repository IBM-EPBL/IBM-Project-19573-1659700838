&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swimming is one of the best exercises that helps people to reduce stress in this urban lifestyle. Swimming pools are found larger in number in hotels, and weekend tourist spots and barely people have them in their house backyard. Beginners, especially, often feel it difficult to breathe underwater which causes breathing trouble which in turn causes a drowning accident. Worldwide, drowning produces a higher rate of mortality without causing injury to children.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By studying body movement patterns and connecting cameras to artificial intelligence (AI) systems we can devise an underwater pool safety system that reduces the risk of drowning. By building an intelligent Drowning Detection system using an AI device that can accurately and effectively monitor swimmers and detect drowning in pools and automatically alert the lifeguard for his assistance.
